**Turn on your computer via network (WoL)**

This macro allows you to power on your computer or any other device on the local network using Wake-on-LAN (WoL).
Simply connect to the same Wi-Fi network, enter the device’s MAC and broadcast address - and MacroDroid will send a special *Magic Packet* to wake it
up.

## ⚙️ How it works

- Sends a Wake-on-LAN UDP packet to the specified address;
- Works if the target device supports and is configured to receive WoL signals;
- Can be triggered manually, on schedule, or automatically when connecting to your home Wi-Fi.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- The target device must be connected via **Ethernet**;
- The **BIOS/UEFI** must have *Wake on LAN* enabled;
- The phone must be connected to the same **Wi-Fi network** as the device.

## 💬 Tip

You can change the trigger - for example, to wake your PC automatically when connecting to home Wi-Fi or by a voice command.
